Hello everyone!

I’m just going to use this site as a place to document my progress as a software engineer and all the various projects that I have completed. Hopefully this will also motivate me to clear the backlog of all the crazy pet project ideas that have been sitting around in my phone’s Notes app.

Why the name of the website you may ask? Well...

- Back then during National Service, I served as a mobile app developer, helping to develop prototype mobile applications for the Army as part of its push for digitalisation. My team and I had to adhere to very strict deadlines in order to satisfy the demands of the project stakeholders and other chief leadership, would regularly evaluate the progress and usefulness of our innovation projects.

- Hence, staying past office hours (or in fact just adhering to it) is not uncommon. Our staff officer, who acted as our product manager, kept a lookout for our welfare and motivated us by treating coffee from the canteen. Every time, he’ll tell us developers to “turn coffee into code”, and it stuck.
<br><br>
-	And I like coffee.
